## Posture Tracker
<p>
A program that will track your posture using a webcam and remind you to sit properly. Currently just a couple scripts I have used for testing OpenFace.
</p>

### Prerequisites
<p>
Posture Tracker uses <a href="https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface">OpenFace</a>, so you need to install OpenFace and everything OpenFace needs (<a href="http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/setup/">Setup instructions for OpenFace</a>).
</p>
<p>
Of course, you also need a webcam.
